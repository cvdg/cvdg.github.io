# Moved to Azure

The Blog is moved from a Linode kubernetes cluster to a new location at Azure, as a Static Web App.

There is nothing wrong with a Linode Kubernetes cluster, but a static web app is a lot simpler and cheaper.

If a new version is commit to Github, a  Github action deploys the site to Azure.
