# Reset

Yesterday I did a reset of my "old" MacBook Pro 16 from 2020 and installed the latest version of 
MacOS. It is nice to have a clean and garbage free desktop.

Today I started (again) with a blog.
This time I want to keep things simple and use Github Pages with Jekyll.

The advantage is that I can checkout the site and edit it on a local machine, but I can also edit 
the site on my iPad in a browser on the go.
