Today I finished the **Pre-Security Path** on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com/)

It was fun, a hands on experience with basic knowledge of:
- Internet
- Protocols
- OSI model
- TCP/IP, UDP/IP, ICMP
- Linux
- Windows

To be honest, must questions I could answer out of mu head, I just struggled with the Windows stuff.
Of course, I am a hardcore Linux system administrator and up until know I had never even glanced at Windows administration,
so it was a bit of fun to walk on the dark side.
