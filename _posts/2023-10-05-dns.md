My domains are registered by [Transip](https://www.transip.nl/),
but my DNS was at [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/).
My email was and is handled by [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail).
Azure also hosted my websites as `static web-apps`.

Azure costs me less than â‚¬2 / month for a little traffic to my personal
websites, I paid mainly for a little DNS traffic.

The source code of all my personal projects, including my websites, are
stored at [Github](https://www.github.com/) and when a project with
a website gets a commit, a `github action` builds the website and
uploads it to Azure to activate the changes.

Github Pages can also serve static websites, so to symplify I want to
remove Azure from the chain.

So the new situation:

* Transip - register domains
* Transip - DNS
* Github - HTTPS static websites
* Proton Mail - SMTP mail
