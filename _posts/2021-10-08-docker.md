## Problem

A `Dockerfile` based on `nginx:stable` or `nginx:latest` didn't build
and gave a error during the compile step with `hugo`.


## Analyse

After checking both `nginx` images, I noticed the `stable` and `latest` image 
for `nginx` on Docker hub, uses the old Debian Buster (10) as base image.

After checking the version of `hugo`, this was for both images an old version
and the website didn't compile.


## Solution

The solution was to use a current Debian Bullseye (11) as base image and
install `nginx` and `hugo` using `apt-get`.
